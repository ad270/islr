ISLR Self-study

This repo supports my self-study of "An Introduction to Statisical Learning with Applications in R".

## Helpful Info
R Install - Win 7, R-3.5.2

RStudio installs packages in user library directory synched to work file server. Moved packages to a new local library folder. For RStudio to automatically recognize this new library, updated Control Panel > User Accounts > Change my environment variables > Add user varable R_LIBS_USER = C:/Program Files/R/win-library/3.5
